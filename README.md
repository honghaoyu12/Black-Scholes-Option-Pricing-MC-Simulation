# Black-Scholes-Option-Pricing-MC-Simulation

This is a notebook illustrating simulation of Black-Scholes equation via Monte-Carlo simulation in Python.  It is a replication of the original notebook(https://github.com/aldodec/Black-Scholes-Option-Pricing-with-Monte-Carlo-/tree/master) and I made it as part of the learning process.

I have corrected some minor mistakes in the original notebook and made minor modifications
